   Setting this to 10px allows us to easily divide everything by 10 (e.g. something we want to be 40px becomes 4rem),
   but using px means users can't change the browser font size for vision problems etc. So instead we make this a percentage.
   Since the default for most browsers is 16px, we divide 10/16 to get 0.625 or 62.5%)

If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, that 100 pixels will include any border or padding you added, and the content box will shrink to absorb that extra width. This typically makes it much easier to size elements. We've made it inherited in the universal selector, so we can put it in body to apply to be inherited by all elements*/
